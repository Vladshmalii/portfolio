## üöÄ **About Me**

I‚Äôm a **Backend Developer and AI Engineer** with over **3.5 years of experience in Python** and **3 years in Django/FastAPI**.  
I build **scalable backend systems**, **AI-driven automation**, and **Web3 integrations** for modern, data-intensive products.

My background includes developing **Telegram bots for businesses**, **high-load APIs**, **payment platforms**, and **AI-powered tools** that monitor, analyze, and act ‚Äî autonomously.  
I work on systems that serve thousands of users daily, emphasizing **stability, clarity, and efficiency**.

I believe that architecture should evolve like a living organism: modular, observable, and adaptable to change ‚Äî without chaos.

## üß† **Philosophy & Approach**

Code should be *alive*, not rigid.  
I treat every project like an evolving ecosystem ‚Äî with feedback loops, automation, and continuous improvement.

- **Clarity over cleverness:** readable code outlives its authors.
- **Automation as philosophy:** machines should handle the routine; humans should create.
- **AI as augmentation:** not a gimmick, but a force multiplier for decision-making and system intelligence.
- **Security as architecture:** encryption, access control, and observability aren‚Äôt add-ons ‚Äî they‚Äôre the foundation.

My goal is to build systems that are not only fast, but *thoughtful* ‚Äî capable of adapting and learning.
